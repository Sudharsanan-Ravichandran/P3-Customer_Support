### **3. Data Source**  
**Description**: The dataset included detailed call logs, customer feedback scores, and agent performance data across multiple departments and locations.  

**Key Variables**:  
- **Agent**: Name of the customer support agent handling calls.  
- **Department**: Product categories (Air Conditioner, Refrigerator, Television, Toaster, Washing Machine).  
- **Location**: City and continent of the call origin.  
- **Customer Satisfaction Rating**: Feedback score provided by customers.  
- **Call Metrics**: Total calls, unanswered calls, unresolved calls, talk duration, speed of answer.

---

### **4. Tools and Techniques**  
**Tools Used**:  
- **Power BI**: For creating the interactive dashboard and visualizations.  
- **Excel**: For initial data cleaning and preparation.  

**Techniques**:  
- Data aggregation by agent, department, location, and customer.  
- Trend analysis for monthly call volumes and average talk durations.  
- Correlation analysis between satisfaction ratings and response speed.

---

### **5. Approach**  
**Step-by-Step Workflow**:  
1. **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and standardized formats for call metrics and feedback scores.  
2. **Data Aggregation**: Summarized call volumes, unresolved calls, satisfaction ratings by department and location.  
3. **Visualization Design**: Created charts (line graphs, bar charts, pie charts) to highlight key insights like unresolved call rates and agent performance.  
4. **Interactivity**: Added slicers for filtering by agent, department, and location to make the dashboard dynamic.

### **6. Key Insights from the Dashboard**
1. **Call Volume Trends**:
   - Total calls peaked on Sundays.
   - Departments like Television and Air Conditioner received the highest number of calls.

2. **Unanswered & Unresolved Calls**:
   - Unanswered call rate was 18.92%, while unresolved call rate was 33.40%.  
   - Specific customers had recurring unresolved issues.

3. **Agent Performance Insights**:
   - Jim handled the highest number of calls (666), followed by Martha (638).  
   - Satisfaction ratings were correlated with talk duration and speed of answer.

4. **Geographical Insights**:
   - Europe had the highest total call volume among continents.
   - Cities like Bangor and Chester had high call volumes across all departments.

5. **Customer Satisfaction Analysis**:
   - Scatter plot revealed a positive correlation between satisfaction ratings and response speed.

---

### **7. Impact**
- Enabled managers to dynamically monitor customer support performance across multiple dimensions (agent, department, location).  
- Identified bottlenecks such as high unresolved call rates for targeted interventions.
- Improved resource allocation by analyzing trends in agent efficiency and customer satisfaction.

### **8. Challenges Faced**
1. Managing large datasets with inconsistent formats required advanced cleaning techniques in Excel before importing into Power BI.
2. Designing an intuitive dashboard layout that balances complexity with usability for stakeholders with varying technical expertise.
